🎭 SCENARIO: City History & Geography

📝 Question 1: "What is the history of Terrace?"
   Should include: Skeena River, forestry, Cedar Pole Capital, 1940s-1950s

💬 AI Response:
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Terrace is situated on the traditional land of the Tsimshian Nation, including the Kitselas and Kitsumkalum First Nations, who have used these lands for millennia. European settlement began with steam-powered riverboats in the mid-1860s, with the Mumford arriving in 1866 to support telegraph line construction. The area saw increased activity due to fishing and gold rushes. In 1905, George Little, often called the "founder of Terrace," arrived and later donated land for the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway station. The town was initially proposed to be named "Littleton" but was renamed "Terrace" reflecting the local landforms and the Tsimshian name for the area. The railway arrived in 1914, linking Terrace to Fort George and Edmonton. The Old Skeena Bridge was built in 1925, and the highway system developed in the 1940s and 50s, impacting downtown Terrace with the growth of automobile use. A highway bypass completed later stimulated growth south of the rail. Need details on a specific aspect of Terrace's history? Just ask!
