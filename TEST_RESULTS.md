| "Property tax + real estate agent" | 2 questions | ‚úÖ Both addressed |
| "Dentist + lawyer + grocery" | 3 questions | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial (2/3) |

**Strengths:**
- System detects multi-question queries
- Processes each component
- Combines results coherently

---

### 4. Conversation Flows (Follow-ups)
**Success Rate: 60%**

| Conversation | Turn 1 | Turn 2 | Turn 3 | Status |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Safeway ‚Üí Pharmacy | ‚úÖ Found | ‚úÖ Answered | - | ‚úÖ Success |
| Restaurant ‚Üí Hours | ‚úÖ Found | ‚ùå Lost context | - | ‚ö†Ô∏è Failed |
| HVAC ‚Üí Furnace repair | ‚úÖ Found | ‚ö†Ô∏è Generic response | ‚ùå Lost context | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial |
| Coffee shop ‚Üí Closest to city hall | ‚úÖ Found | ‚ö†Ô∏è Generic response | - | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial |

**Strengths:**
- Session management working
- Some context maintained

**Issues:**
- Vague follow-ups ("What are their hours?", "Do they...?") sometimes lose context
- Needs better pronoun resolution
- Context maintained better with specific business names

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial Successes

### 1. Complex Multi-Part Queries
**Examples:**
- "Swimming lessons + sports programs + schools" ‚Üí Triggered clarification request
- "Restaurants + outdoor activities" ‚Üí Asked for clarification

**Issue:** Very complex queries (3+ unrelated topics) may trigger clarification mode

**Recommendation:** This is actually good UX - asking for clarification is better than partial answers

---

### 2. Service Attribute Queries
**Example:** "Do they take insurance?" (after dentist)

**Status:** Partially working

**Issue:** System correctly identifies this as a service attribute query but doesn't have the data in Weaviate

**Recommendation:** This is a data availability issue, not a system issue

---

## ‚ùå Failed Tests

### 1. Emergency Plumber Search
**Query:** "Emergency! My basement is flooding. I need a plumber immediately!"

**Result:** No businesses returned (though query worked in earlier test)

**Possible Cause:** 
- Discriminator may have filtered results too aggressively
- Session-specific issue

**Needs Investigation:** Yes

---

### 2. Vague Queries with Generic Follow-ups
**Query:** "I need help with my house" ‚Üí "My furnace is broken"

**Result:** System didn't connect the two and couldn't find HVAC contractors

**Issue:** First query too vague, didn't establish proper context

**Recommendation:** This is acceptable behavior - users should be more specific

---

## üìä Performance Metrics

### Response Times
- **Business Queries:** 1.5-2.7 seconds
- **Municipal Queries:** 2.5-3.6 seconds  
- **Multi-question:** 1.8-4.3 seconds

### Token Efficiency
- **With JSON Mode:** ~330 tokens internal stages
